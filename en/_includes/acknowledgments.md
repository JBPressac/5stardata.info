Kudos to [Andy Seaborne](https://twitter.com/andyseaborne) for pointing out the CSV bug,
to [Kerstin Forsberg](https://twitter.com/kerfors) for suggesting the 'data highlighting' in the four- and five-star examples, as well as to [Vassilios Peristeras](https://twitter.com/vassilios) for proposing to explain not only the 'what' but also the 'why'. Thanks to [Egon Willighagen](https://twitter.com/egonwillighagen) for providing more details about benefits of one-star data.
