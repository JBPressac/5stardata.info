# 5 &#x2605; OPEN DATA

This is the source code repository for the [5-star Open Data] advocacy site. The site is a [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)-based site, with pages written in HTML and [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) (specifically [Kramdown](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html)), with Markdown being used where possible for ease of translating and editing.

## Contributing to the site

A great way to contribute to the site is to create an [issue](https://github.com/mhausenblas/5stardata.info/issues) on GitHub when you encounter a problem or something. We always appreciate it. You can also edit the code by yourself and create a pull request.

### Translating the site

Translating the site is straightforward. If you can't see a version in your language, here is how to do it.

1. Create a new language folder with the [ISO two letter languages code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes).
2. Copy all the files of the English version in the `en` folder to your newly created language folder.
3. Translate the content with a text editor, or on GitHub.
4. Create a pull request so that the editors can add it to the site.

## Branches

- **gh-pages**: live site
- **[master](https://github.com/mhausenblas/5stardata.info/tree/master)**: original version, for archiving (not used anymore)

All here in the Public Domain (unless otherwise noted), as usual. ;)
